Handouts, course scripts, and data from [BSSD 2023](https://ced.cat/courses/barcelona-summer-school-of-demography/) Module 1: Introduction to R

This repository has everything required to reproduce the course scripts. Well, almost everything. Some data files will be introduced over the course of the week, and I'll probably need to stash them somewhere in the cloud, instructions forthcoming.

1. Monday 3 July "Getting Started". see `Lecture1.pdf`
